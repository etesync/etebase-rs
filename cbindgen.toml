#
# technically possible values (that shouldn't have a purpose here):
# * "SnakeCase": apply no renaming

# for how this applies to fields. Renaming of the variant assumes that the input
# is the Rust standard PascalCase. In the case of QualifiedScreamingSnakeCase,
# it also assumed that the enum's name is PascalCase.
#
# possible values (that actually do something):
# * "CamelCase": MyVariant => myVariant
# * "SnakeCase": MyVariant => my_variant
# * "ScreamingSnakeCase": MyVariant => MY_VARIANT
